There should be tests here, but I'm running out of time, so I'm just going to put some manual tests here.



TEST CASE 1: Basic working example

Input: 1, 4, (sort 1), 27, (sort all)
Output: Site has bank: (empty), odds: [1, 27], evens: [4]

Test CASE 2: Negatives work
Input: -1, (sort all)
Output: Site has bank: (empty), odds: [-1], evens: (empty)

TEST CASE 3: Strings don't work
Input: a, (sort 1)
Output: Site has bank: (empty), odds: (empty), evens: (empty)
    Site ALSO sends alert describing error

TEST CASE 4: Whole numbers only
Input: 3.14159, (sort 1)
Output: Site has bank: (empty), odds: (empty), evens: (empty)
    Site ALSO sends alert describing error
